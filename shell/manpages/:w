# Permissions
|   Permission          |   Description |
|   r (read)            |   For a normal file, this allows a user to view the contents of the file. For a directory, it allows a user to view the names of files in the directory.  |
|   w (write)           |   For a normal file, this allows a user to modify and delete the file. For a directory, it allows a user to create, rename, and delete files inthe directory. |
|   x (execute)         |   For a normal file, this allows a user to execute the file if the user also has read permissions on it. For a directory, it allows a user to access file information in the directory, effectively permitting them to change into it (cd) or list its contents (ls). |
|   s                   |   is the setuid/setgid permission applied to an executable file. A user running it inherits the effective privileges of the owner or group of the file.   |
|   t                   |   is the sticky bit, which is only relevant for directories. If set, it prevents nonroot users from deleting files in it, unless said user owns the directory/file.   |
